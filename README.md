### Update: September 14, 2013

I have some exciting news to share, two developers have joined onto this project with me! Welcome aboard, James and Chris! :)

We have been working over the past few weeks to catch up with each other, which is why the source code updates have been quiet. Going forward, development will be happening under a shared repository (see the links below). All source code will continue to be published in the public domain.

The current source code has been a great way for me to learn about Bitcoin and to prototype out a design. In the new, shared repository we'll have a lot more up front design work done, and the code will be implemented in a more final, clean fashion. Having a team to work with will help with this significantly.
